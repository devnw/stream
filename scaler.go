// Scaler implements generic auto-scaling logic which starts with a net-zero
// set of processing routines (with the exception of the channel listener) and
// then scales up and down based on the CPU contention of a system and the speed
// at which the InterceptionFunc is able to process data. Once the incoming
// channel becomes blocked (due to nothing being sent) each of the spawned
// routines will finish out their execution of Fn and then the internal timer
// will collapse brining the routine count back to zero until there is more to
// be done.
//
// To use Scalar, simply create a new Scaler[T, U], configuring the Wait, Life,
// and InterceptFunc fields. These fields are what configure the functionality
// of the Scaler.
//
// NOTE: Fn is REQUIRED!
// Defaults: Wait = 1ns, Life = 1Âµs
//
// After creating the Scaler instance and configuring it, call the Exec method
// passing the appropriate context and input channel.
//
// Internally the Scaler implementation will wait for data on the incoming
// channel and attempt to send it to a layer2 channel. If the layer2 channel
// is blocking and the Wait time has been reached, then the Scaler will spawn
// a new layer2 which will increase throughput for the Scaler, and Scaler
// will attempt to send the data to the layer2 channel once more. This process
// will repeat until a successful send occurs. (This should only loop twice).
